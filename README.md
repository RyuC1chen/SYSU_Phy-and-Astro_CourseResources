# SYSU_Phy-and-Astro_CourseResources

In this project, I uploaded almost all the learning materials of the main courses I've learned. Anyone is welcome to download these files whether you're a SYSU student or not, sharing the study resources to make them be public is what I'm devoted to.

## 1. English Version

In this project, I uploaded and published some relevant notes, textbooks, and some homework & exercises for Undergraduate Physics Courses at SYSU. These files are suitable for Sophomore students, ALTHOUGH THEY'RE NOT ABSOLUTELY COMPLETE...

Remember these files are based on Chinese..  And the writer is still updating this project when he is free.

Maybe you will not find what you want, but it takes the writer a lot of time to collect them... I will try to make them as complete as possible.

If you have any suggestions, you can email me at _**zz1taiyyl@gmail.com**_. 

*And make sure to remember that you should download 'Yunji' APP (云记)* to open these '. Jnotes' files in this APP, so that you can view them at any time. (I'll try to transform these Jnotes files into PDF or the other versions)

本人是中山大学雾天2021本科生，我将把我大学上过的大部分课的笔记和相关资料上传到这个项目里，以帮助各位能够在学习中更省时省力。_*我一直致力于DATA PUBLICIZATION，大学知识和资源垄断在我看来是非常难以容忍的，如果我的帮助能让各位读者的学习更轻松、成绩更好，我将深感荣幸。*_

由于大一很多部分课程的笔记是纸质的，我没有办法将它们上传，但我会将我的部分物理实验报告上传以供各位参考。_*切记中大实验严查抄袭，如果被发现对你我都不是好事，所以请记住实验报告仅供参考！！！！可以参考我们的实验步骤和数据处理方法，但数据和撰写需靠各位自力而行（而且我的实验报告的成绩普遍不高XD）*_

大二大部分课程我都使用 *云记* 进行记录
