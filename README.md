# SYSU_Phy-and-Astro_CourseResources

In this project, I uploaded almost all the learning materials of the main courses I've learned. Anyone is welcome to download these files whether you're a SYSU student or not, sharing the study resources to make them be public is what I'm devoted to.

## 1. English Version

In this project, I uploaded and published some relevant notes, textbooks, and some homework & exercises for Undergraduate Physics Courses at SYSU. These files are suitable for Sophomore students, ALTHOUGH THEY'RE NOT ABSOLUTELY COMPLETE...

Remember these files are based on Chinese..  And the writer is still updating this project when he is free.

Maybe you will not find what you want, but it takes the writer a lot of time to collect them... I will try to make them as complete as possible.

If you have any suggestions, you can email me at _**zz1taiyyl@gmail.com**_. 

*And make sure to remember that you should download 'Yunji' APP (云记)* to open these '. Jnotes' files in this APP, so that you can view them at any time. (I'll try to transform these Jnotes files into PDF or the other versions)
